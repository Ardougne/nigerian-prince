Dr. Bakare Tunde is a Discord Hack Week shitpost bot that DMs users ridiculous scam emails.

Every time a user sends a message on a server that he is a member of, they have a 1/1000 chance of receiving a DM from him containing part of an email intended to scam the receiver out of money while telling a clearly false yet somehow beautiful story. When the user replies to the DM, they receive the next portion of the email. All potentially harmful information has been removed, so the receiver is safe, and hopefully amused.

His prefix is "+". The default message frequency is 1000 (a 1/1000 chance of receiving a DM), but this can be changed using +change_frequency <new_freq>, where new_freq is the integer reciprocal of the probability of receiving a DM.
